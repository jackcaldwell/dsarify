Each one MUST stack up against each other and deliver a “VALUE” and we compare that against all the developments within the business.\n\n \n\nYou as HOT of that team, will write the business case for these – eg What is saving or what is the commercial opportunity.\n\n \n\nExample -  I have a live example of a request I have rejected – Someone within your team wanted an update doing on Trade vehicles so that when they were being sold, the vehicle was marked as loaded. I have done a quick calculation, and that development would assist us in less than .5% of all bookings. The actual dev would take 3-4 days. We don’t have 3-4 days for a dev that will impact 1 booking in 200 – we have to: [REDACTED NAME] manually somehow. The developments we MUST focus on are the ones to: [REDACTED NAME] team blockers, and that’s what I will focus on.\n\n \n\nThis is YOUR team, managing YOUR pipeline in terms of priority. I am here to: [REDACTED NAME] process.\n\n \n\nI don’t want this appear to: [REDACTED NAME], you team need to: [REDACTED NAME] do anything and everything to help….but you guys must help yourselves in terms of organising the priority. So from: [REDACTED NAME] below – what are your TOP 3 in terms of delivering the highest value, and why ?\n\n \n\nCan you chase up all the Team leaders for their recommendations and lets see and come up multiple times 😉\n\n \n\nBR\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Wednesday, 22 May 2024 at 12:11\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nCc: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: System improvements / ideas\n\nHi [REDACTED NAME],\n\n \n\n \n\nImplementing several of these suggestions would undoubtedly benefit both the team and other departments.\n\n \n\n \n\nENS builder (how and when can we make it fully automated?).\n\nENS builder – Stena Line forms to: [REDACTED NAME] and validated. The team shouldn’t be handling it.\n\nPPB – Port passes to: [REDACTED NAME] and validated by operators' systems. (validation part is missing).\n\nInformation page reviewed, relevant information + booking process where applicable. I’m already in discussion with John, he is pushing Zone leads for accurate information. To: [REDACTED NAME] the learning process we have requested a box to: [REDACTED NAME] “How to book”. Dev request was submitted last week.\n\nF2 / F3 needs to: [REDACTED NAME] interactive, with some sort of reminders / warnings (pop-ups?)\n\nF2 – When booking an abnormal load, the price should disappear after selecting \"abnormal.\"\n\nF2 – When repeating the job, weight, width, and height should automatically change to standard.\n\nZone leads to: [REDACTED NAME] accounts where possible + clear info in information tab (Virtu Ferries and smaller ones).\n\nAdditional EDIs where possible (Tallink – all bookings support).\n\nOperators’ emails – Adding round-trip booking requests (Condor Ferries and IOM).\n\nAmendments + Cancellation for EDI bookings to: [REDACTED NAME] (Web + App)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of CS",

      "body": "Hi [REDACTED NAME],\n\n \n\nAs discussed in SMM attached is a breakdown of the Sales sources and other descriptions we use. As I indicated, it’s a lot more complex than a simple “sales source”. The different data capture points have grown over many years to: [REDACTED NAME] different requirements. I have tried to: [REDACTED NAME] of these and provide a breakdown.\n\n \n\nThe single closest thing we have to a single source of truth is Sales source. This is driven from: [REDACTED NAME] up in web / app > F2F2 > Account open > Sales input into a new tab in F2F2 manually. If the sales guys used this properly, we genuinely have a better picture. There are some fail safes in here to: [REDACTED NAME] stop sales manipulating the inbound sales and saying they converted it. I found generally they took an inbound call or rang an existing web/app account and then claimed a conversion,. Yes its sales….its farming not hunting. Appreciate we need both. I have been here many times with sales. When we scratch the surface, we discover some bending of the truths.\n\n \n\nI always encouraged sales to: [REDACTED NAME] sales on an annual basis to deliver +20% costs. The year prior sales then became a  “house account”. Hence the reason converted by “X” 2024 / 2025 etc so we could track individual performance in that year.  \n\n \n\nNot complaining, we have done this exercise last year when we tried to: [REDACTED NAME] to follow a process. The original doc [REDACTED NAME] produced is also attached.\n\n \n\nAgain, not complaining, this took me 1h 45m today to: [REDACTED NAME] get into the details and test the data. I hope this helps you get a better understanding. Ordinarily I know you would go to: [REDACTED NAME] this, but I said I would deliver.\n\n \n\nMy POV, I think we make do with what we have and use it as intended and tighten up the process, or we bend the existing structures for new uses as you and John see fit. NB doing the second will muddy historical reporting. It’s not impossible, but please be-aware of the limitations this path would deliver. The data capture is complex and ties into many threads. As you know later this year, we will be looking to integrate a CRM, I would suggest that’s the time to: [REDACTED NAME] change things.\n\n \n\nHowever this might be a bit disappointing in terms of change, I hope that’s all helpful.\n\n \n\nHappy to: [REDACTED NAME] when we both have time.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

Pulse – Should be able to: [REDACTED NAME] together and will compare with Stena as I think we were slightly better.\n 5. Hercules – Whittles and Ferry Agent - Will leave you a blank slide.\n 6. Long Tail – Will leave you a blank slide.\n 7. Partners – Will provide an update.\n 8. AOB – Spoke with John and he as spoken to: [REDACTED NAME] Haulier rates and she is ok with it but has said she needs to get a group offering and will liaise with the other guys at Stena.

It was a pleasure to: [REDACTED NAME] here, and I hope you had a safe journey home.\n\n \n\nI would like to: [REDACTED NAME] topics we discussed and outline the actions I am already working on:\n\n \n\nOnline Authorization - Phase 2:\n\n * [REDACTED NAME], needs to: [REDACTED NAME] API Specification ([REDACTED NAME]) to Freightlink. Please find attached.\n * Freightlink should share the email addresses required for accessing our API console. There you will find the OAuth and the API Keys that can be generated.\n * Freightlink and UTA need to: [REDACTED NAME] use cases, with each party contributing their requirements.\n\nSome points to: [REDACTED NAME] for the use cases:\n\n * Card authorization for immediate bookings,\n * Cancellation of bookings,\n * Card authorization for future crossings,\n * Transaction file generation.\n\n(Our API Specification currently covers the first two scenarios: booking and crossing in the near future, as well as cancellations.)\n\n \n\nCustoms Link/Declarations:\n\n * There will be no registration fees for UTA customers accessing the customs link through UTA Ferry.\n * Declarations can be generated entirely (import, export) via the customs link, including future declarations such as SSGB, ENS, ELO, and ICS2.\n * Customs services will be available digitally for the following countries: UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Portugal. No on-site offices are involved.\n * John, could you please provide more information on additional customs services available to: [REDACTED NAME]?\n * John and I still need to: [REDACTED NAME] pricing and conditions.\n * [REDACTED NAME] will send an email regarding the new ELO declarations and a “How To” document for sales.\n\n \n\nSales Training:\n\n * Training sessions will be organized by region after we finalize the customs link and declarations in UTA Ferry.\n\n \n\nIn the UTA Ferry Portal:\n\n * Replace box 3 with the Irish Ferries offer.\n * Offer on Dover-Calais at [REDACTED AMOUNT] via Irish Ferries.\n * The offer on Dover-Calais and Dover-Dunkerque, including a free meal on board for [REDACTED AMOUNT] via DFDS, remains unchanged.\n * UTA will reactivate the conditions for Dover-Calais.\n\n \n\nOffers - John:\n\n * Irish Ferries\n * Price stages for the most popular routes\n * Customs services\n\n \n\nIntermodal Information:\n\n * I will clarify whether we are permitted to: [REDACTED NAME] unaccompanied service to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nUTA Tolls:\n\n * Support Freightlink with toll solutions for customers purchasing UTA toll boxes.\n\n \n\nMonthly Reporting:\n\n * Freightlink will generate monthly reports to: [REDACTED NAME] with UTA.\n\n \n\nCustomer Mass Communication:\n\n * Special offers and better rates on select routes\n * Customs declarations through UTA Ferry\n * Mandatory declarations\n\n \n\n \n\nAdditionally, in case you’ve changed your address due to: [REDACTED NAME] office, please send me your new address so we can update our systems and make a small amendment to: [REDACTED NAME]. I think it must be relevant also for when we receive invoices from Freightlink, that we update this information. Also, can the addendum be signed digitally via DocuSing? If so, can I add you, John, to: [REDACTED NAME] for Freightlink?\n\n \n\nA follow-up meeting at the end of September to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] \n\nStrategic Partner Management\n\nPartner Manager Plus Services\nT/ + [REDACTED PHONE]-192\n\nM/ +49 [REDACTED PHONE]\n[REDACTED URL]\nUNION TANK Eckstein GmbH & Co.

Easy way forward, there simply wasn’t any effort.\n\n * We need a team that will deliver.\n * I need to: [REDACTED NAME] from: [REDACTED NAME] SMT and any other duties.\n * We need to: [REDACTED NAME] design tools similar to: [REDACTED NAME] – we don’t do this whatsoever or at least on a competitive scale.\n * This will take time and if the above isn’t in place it simply cannot be done.\n * Costs will be a major contributor, and without partners or resource we will simply fail.  \n * We need accreditations - why would someone trust us with freight if we are not accredited -\n * We keep the own vehicles going different supplier and trial for two more months.\n * We need partners and suppliers to: [REDACTED NAME] and have the workload to: [REDACTED NAME] the arm we need whilst taking commercial risks and understanding commerciality, not job by job analysis.  \n\n \n\n3 If the answer is no\n\n * We salvage what business we have and want to: [REDACTED NAME] transfer or give notice\n * We commence processing now the human aspects\n\n \n\nThis is unfortunately the reality of how logistics work, with very fine margins, high work levels and little reward, a lot of business is won on costs alone, and is a good fit for primary work already in place.\n\n \n\nE: john@freightlink.co.uk\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\nJohn Gaskell\n\nHead Of Sales and Contract Logistics\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT]. Email Disclaimer | Privacy | Terms & Conditions\n\nAll business is transacted under the current edition of the BIFA Standard Trading Conditions.",

      "body": "Gents,\n\n \n\nAs times ticks on, I believe the role of commercial manager is becoming ever more critical to: [REDACTED NAME] in 2024+. As we go through the process and CV’s, the more I consider this conundrum. It becomes more and more apparent to: [REDACTED NAME] if we appoint the wrong person, [REDACTED NAME], closely followed by [REDACTED NAME], end up spending an increasing amount of time doing what you have both done for months which is backfilling [REDACTED NAME] role…whilst under increasing pressure. The role is that critical, failure means we really do apply pressure to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nIf we do make a good appointment, there is the fact that we will lose 3+ months as “X” learns the ropes. Equally [REDACTED NAME], one of your strong feelings was always to: [REDACTED NAME] touch with sales. This position weakens that link, and in fact, the new owner of that team, we as directors become increasingly more reliant on them to: [REDACTED NAME] results for 2024. It’s a tough ask for someone with industry knowledge let alone a newbie !\n\n \n\nI want to put a spotlight on the elephant. [REDACTED NAME]’s knowledge of “CUSTOMS” is very low (I am sure you will not mind me pointing this out). However, [REDACTED NAME] continues to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and the team to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. The no 1 problem we have in CL is SALES. [REDACTED NAME]’s engagement here is low to medium. To: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME], we have witnessed [REDACTED NAME] ratcheting the rhetoric with CL strategy. I must assume this is not just a [REDACTED NAME] thought. Equally we all agree CL holds the BIGGEST opportunity of the 3 pillars. With this, we need to find a way to: [REDACTED NAME] best, [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] chances of success.\n\n \n\nSo how do we DE-RISK the sales, and IMPROVE % OF SUCCESS & PERFORMANCE ??? Lets not take anything from: [REDACTED NAME], and I accept this is not an exact round peg in a round hole, but I think this rounds a square peg….it is not a finished product !\n\n \n\nSee Organogram PAGE 2\n\nAttached Headlines:-\n\n \n\n a. Help [REDACTED NAME] with a heavy weight – [REDACTED NAME] takes over managing CS and supports that unit. I have called here “office manager” so she can carry on with some of the tasks she manages now.\n b. Back fill Jens role with a relatively lower salaried project manager £ 30k - £ 35K – see (e)\n c. Decrease [REDACTED NAME]’s direct management reports to focus. In Q1, [REDACTED NAME] report to John (think that was the plan – so nothing new then)\n d. [REDACTED NAME] takes over Freightlink / CustomsLink sales inc partners – I think I have said this before, put the best, [REDACTED NAME] the best, [REDACTED NAME]. He has done this job prior to a very high standard, so this massively de-risks the business position. Yes the learning curve remains with CL sales, BUT [REDACTED NAME] is a accomplished sales professional.\n e. LUMPY BIT 1)[REDACTED NAME] takes back strategic responsibility of CustomsLink..OR…2)we have to: [REDACTED NAME] unicorn to: [REDACTED NAME] business forward. If (2) delivers better performance, at this stage we cancel (b) above, [REDACTED NAME] will pick this up, and the digital has to manage. I think this is viable NOW, but when I am removed, it probably needs that skill.\n f. I don’t have a finalised vision of e2 (new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward.\n g. E2 – the new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward, I am not 100% convinced [REDACTED NAME] could deliver this. He is good guy, I am not convinced [REDACTED NAME] is that and I think he is C 70K – his old job was £ 90k)\n h. WILD CARD – is there a better solution WITH John within the business ? I have run out of time to: [REDACTED NAME] one through – but smells like 70K ????\n\n \n\nI know in the past [REDACTED NAME] you have been uneasy with structure changes. I will be honest I don’t, If a team is not working as well as it could, change it in my view. I feel [REDACTED NAME] you worry about the Stena Line POV. My thoughts are IF any of the above sticks, we say nothing at the board meeting next week. When we visit in March, we tell them what we did to: [REDACTED NAME]. That shows good leadership.  \n\n \n\nFor our internal team, these are all comfortable changes with no sudden jolts that would concern me when speaking to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nGents 100% I am not being mischievous here. I want what is best, [REDACTED NAME] business, and I know my opinions are challenging for your both. I am sorry for that, but in equal measure I need to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and thoughts.\n\n \n\nI really hope this helps in some way.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

This unfortunately means we’re not in a position to: [REDACTED NAME] packages or costs at this time. The business is reliant on achieving its budget targets.\nWe shared our 2026 budget plans with you, which I trust you agree are realistic and take into account the challenges your team has faced this year. The budget reflects the current run rate with a 10% uplift, and you’ll also benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] work from: [REDACTED NAME] following John’s departure.\nYour continued commitment and support in delivering this plan is essential. You've made it clear that you do not wish to: [REDACTED NAME] hiring a new BDM at this stage, and we respect that decision. You know your clients and market better than anyone, and we support your approach. However, it’s vital that we see a clear recovery plan that drives growth.\nI was encouraged to: [REDACTED NAME] you and your team will take ownership of generating new sales. As you know, we’ve struggled to: [REDACTED NAME] this front in recent years, and we must avoid repeating that pattern in 2026.\nTo: [REDACTED NAME], we need to: [REDACTED NAME] a set of key KPIs that you and the team are fully aligned with. If we fall short of these KPIs, we must be prepared to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. We cannot afford to: [REDACTED NAME] a plan that isn’t delivering results. If something isn’t working, we need to: [REDACTED NAME]—quickly and decisively. \nThese KPIs will primarily focus on new business development and sales growth. Let’s work together to: [REDACTED NAME] have a robust framework in place to: [REDACTED NAME] drive performance. \nIn recognition of your support and the extra hard work you will undertake in 2026, we will adjust your package as follows:-\n\n\n * Current salary [REDACTED AMOUNT] plus bonus\n * Monthly bonus 2025 (amended immediately) on target [REDACTED AMOUNT] per month (as discussed [REDACTED NAME] will agree these with you)\n * 01st Jan 2026 [REDACTED AMOUNT] (10.5% / [REDACTED AMOUNT])\n\n\n\nFor 2026, we will also amend your monthly targets as follows. This provides you with an easier initial target to hit (on budget), plus the ability to: [REDACTED NAME] more bonus as your overachieve.\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nMonth GP\n\nQuarter GP\n\nAnnual GP\n\nAnnualised bonus if all achieved\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n5%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n10%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n20%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n30%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n \n\nThis is a substantial step forward and underlines our support of you. This must also be seen as a stepped change in not just your effort but your continued growth in professionalism. [REDACTED NAME], [REDACTED NAME] and myself are committed to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] achieve the above, but also your personal growth goals.\n\n\nBefore we put this increase formally in writing from: [REDACTED NAME], I would like you to: [REDACTED NAME] have your full commitment going forward. \n\n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\nT: + 44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\nW: www.freightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector",

Marimosa – it is understood that this matter may not need to: [REDACTED NAME] further.  We agreed on a fixed fee of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT for that work, which we would discount by the percentage corresponding to: [REDACTED NAME] option which you chose should you proceed with that.  We’d then translate that discounted figure into the corresponding number of hours at the discounted hourly rates under the retainer.  Put simply, if you opted for a 4 hour retainer then we would discount by 15% to [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT and at my hourly rate of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT under the retainer, this would equate to 4.5 hours.\n\n \n\n 2. T&Cs Update – I anticipate this taking no more than 1 hour of time, reviewing whether there are any consequential amendments required in addition to: [REDACTED NAME] required additional provisions regarding refunds and for certainty would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at this amount (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n 3. White Label Agreement – as mentioned, we created a form of WLA for CustomsLink to: [REDACTED NAME] relationship with the RHA and notwithstanding that this was a heavily negotiated document, we can utilise this as a starting point for creating a similar version for FLS.  There will be a degree of work to ‘decompile’ where we arrived with RHA and to: [REDACTED NAME] it properly suits the needs of FLS (meanwhile reviewing the other form of WLA which has been being used to: [REDACTED NAME] useful provisions).  I would estimate 6.5 – 7.5 hours but for certainty, would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at 7.5 hours (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nAs stated above, I have attached our retainer proposal.  As you’ll see, we have set out (Partner-led) options varying from 4 up to 10 hours per month with discounts on our normal hourly rates increasing, the more hours you opt for.  I would suggest that with a start date of 1 June, a 4 hour retainer may be of benefit at the outset if you did wish to: [REDACTED NAME] up and I would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] the Marimosa work and the above work into this in line with the hours stated.  I’d also wrap up our AS24 file and include any further work on that project within the retainer too from: [REDACTED NAME] forwards.  The attached should explain how the retainer works but as stated, you may roll over unused time and additional time would be charged at the discounted ‘additional rate’.  Under retainers, we raise our first invoice after 3 months so as to: [REDACTED NAME] the increased amount of initial work which we typically fine and ensure that you benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] value.\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME]\nSent: 09 May 2023 13:20\nTo: '[REDACTED NAME]' <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nHi [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nNoted and understood.  I have any time Monday or Tuesday AM next week if either of those work for you?  I’ll send round a Teams for whenever is convenient for you on those days.\n\n \n\nThanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 09 May 2023 12:35\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nThis Message originated outside your organization.",

He knows that discussion needs to: [REDACTED NAME] this week.

      "body": "Just to: [REDACTED NAME] in the loop – I think [REDACTED NAME] will feel VERY VERY sore at this proposal.\n\n \n\nAdded to which I am sticking to: [REDACTED NAME] re Super Cargo which I think he feels undermines him, it’s a tricky moment in time.\n\n \n\nBR\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Tuesday, 21 November 2023 at 22:22\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>, [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Commercial role\n\nGents,\n\n \n\nAs times ticks on, I believe the role of commercial manager is becoming ever more critical to: [REDACTED NAME] in 2024+. As we go through the process and CV’s, the more I consider this conundrum. It becomes more and more apparent to: [REDACTED NAME] if we appoint the wrong person, [REDACTED NAME], closely followed by [REDACTED NAME], end up spending an increasing amount of time doing what you have both done for months which is backfilling [REDACTED NAME] role…whilst under increasing pressure. The role is that critical, failure means we really do apply pressure to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nIf we do make a good appointment, there is the fact that we will lose 3+ months as “X” learns the ropes. Equally [REDACTED NAME], one of your strong feelings was always to: [REDACTED NAME] touch with sales. This position weakens that link, and in fact, the new owner of that team, we as directors become increasingly more reliant on them to: [REDACTED NAME] results for 2024. It’s a tough ask for someone with industry knowledge let alone a newbie !\n\n \n\nI want to put a spotlight on the elephant. [REDACTED NAME]’s knowledge of “CUSTOMS” is very low (I am sure you will not mind me pointing this out). However, [REDACTED NAME] continues to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and the team to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. The no 1 problem we have in CL is SALES. [REDACTED NAME]’s engagement here is low to medium. To: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME], we have witnessed [REDACTED NAME] ratcheting the rhetoric with CL strategy. I must assume this is not just a [REDACTED NAME] thought. Equally we all agree CL holds the BIGGEST opportunity of the 3 pillars. With this, we need to find a way to: [REDACTED NAME] best, [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] chances of success.\n\n \n\nSo how do we DE-RISK the sales, and IMPROVE % OF SUCCESS & PERFORMANCE ??? Lets not take anything from: [REDACTED NAME], and I accept this is not an exact round peg in a round hole, but I think this rounds a square peg….it is not a finished product !\n\n \n\nSee Organogram PAGE 2\n\nAttached Headlines:-\n\n \n\n a. Help [REDACTED NAME] with a heavy weight – [REDACTED NAME] takes over managing CS and supports that unit. I have called here “office manager” so she can carry on with some of the tasks she manages now.\n b. Back fill [REDACTED NAME] role with a relatively lower salaried project manager £ 30k - £ 35K – see (e)\n c. Decrease [REDACTED NAME]’s direct management reports to focus. In Q1, [REDACTED NAME] report to John (think that was the plan – so nothing new then)\n d. [REDACTED NAME] takes over Freightlink / CustomsLink sales inc partners – I think I have said this before, put the best, [REDACTED NAME] the best, [REDACTED NAME]. He has done this job prior to a very high standard, so this massively de-risks the business position. Yes the learning curve remains with CL sales, BUT [REDACTED NAME] is a accomplished sales professional.\n e. LUMPY BIT 1)[REDACTED NAME] takes back strategic responsibility of CustomsLink..OR…2)we have to: [REDACTED NAME] unicorn to: [REDACTED NAME] business forward. If (2) delivers better performance, at this stage we cancel (b) above, [REDACTED NAME] will pick this up, and the digital has to manage. I think this is viable NOW, but when I am removed, it probably needs that skill.\n f. I don’t have a finalised vision of e2 (new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward.\n g. E2 – the new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward, I am not 100% convinced [REDACTED NAME] could deliver this. He is good guy, I am not convinced [REDACTED NAME] is that and I think he is C 70K – his old job was £ 90k)\n h. WILD CARD – is there a better solution WITH John within the business ? I have run out of time to: [REDACTED NAME] one through – but smells like 70K ????\n\n \n\nI know in the past [REDACTED NAME] you have been uneasy with structure changes. I will be honest I don’t, If a team is not working as well as it could, change it in my view. I feel [REDACTED NAME] you worry about the Stena Line POV. My thoughts are IF any of the above sticks, we say nothing at the board meeting next week. When we visit in March, we tell them what we did to: [REDACTED NAME]. That shows good leadership.  \n\n \n\nFor our internal team, these are all comfortable changes with no sudden jolts that would concern me when speaking to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nGents 100% I am not being mischievous here. I want what is best, [REDACTED NAME] business, and I know my opinions are challenging for your both. I am sorry for that, but in equal measure I need to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and thoughts.\n\n \n\nI really hope this helps in some way.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

Each one MUST stack up against each other and deliver a “VALUE” and we compare that against all the developments within the business.\n\n \n\nYou as HOT of that team, will write the business case for these – eg What is saving or what is the commercial opportunity.\n\n \n\nExample -  I have a live example of a request I have rejected – Someone within your team wanted an update doing on Trade vehicles so that when they were being sold, the vehicle was marked as loaded. I have done a quick calculation, and that development would assist us in less than .5% of all bookings. The actual dev would take 3-4 days. We don’t have 3-4 days for a dev that will impact 1 booking in 200 – we have to: [REDACTED NAME] manually somehow. The developments we MUST focus on are the ones to: [REDACTED NAME] team blockers, and that’s what I will focus on.\n\n \n\nThis is YOUR team, managing YOUR pipeline in terms of priority. I am here to: [REDACTED NAME] process.\n\n \n\nI don’t want this appear to: [REDACTED NAME], you team need to: [REDACTED NAME] do anything and everything to help….but you guys must help yourselves in terms of organising the priority. So from: [REDACTED NAME] below – what are your TOP 3 in terms of delivering the highest value, and why ?\n\n \n\nCan you chase up all the Team leaders for their recommendations and lets see and come up multiple times 😉\n\n \n\nBR\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Wednesday, 22 May 2024 at 12:11\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nCc: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: System improvements / ideas\n\nHi [REDACTED NAME],\n\n \n\n \n\nImplementing several of these suggestions would undoubtedly benefit both the team and other departments.\n\n \n\n \n\nENS builder (how and when can we make it fully automated?).\n\nENS builder – Stena Line forms to: [REDACTED NAME] and validated. The team shouldn’t be handling it.\n\nPPB – Port passes to: [REDACTED NAME] and validated by operators' systems. (validation part is missing).\n\nInformation page reviewed, relevant information + booking process where applicable. I’m already in discussion with John, he is pushing Zone leads for accurate information. To: [REDACTED NAME] the learning process we have requested a box to: [REDACTED NAME] “How to book”. Dev request was submitted last week.\n\nF2 / F3 needs to: [REDACTED NAME] interactive, with some sort of reminders / warnings (pop-ups?)\n\nF2 – When booking an abnormal load, the price should disappear after selecting \"abnormal.\"\n\nF2 – When repeating the job, weight, width, and height should automatically change to standard.\n\nZone leads to: [REDACTED NAME] accounts where possible + clear info in information tab (Virtu Ferries and smaller ones).\n\nAdditional EDIs where possible (Tallink – all bookings support).\n\nOperators’ emails – Adding round-trip booking requests (Condor Ferries and IOM).\n\nAmendments + Cancellation for EDI bookings to: [REDACTED NAME] (Web + App)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nRegards,\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of CS",

Easy way forward, there simply wasn’t any effort.\n\n * We need a team that will deliver.\n * I need to: [REDACTED NAME] from: [REDACTED NAME] SMT and any other duties.\n * We need to: [REDACTED NAME] design tools similar to: [REDACTED NAME] – we don’t do this whatsoever or at least on a competitive scale.\n * This will take time and if the above isn’t in place it simply cannot be done.\n * Costs will be a major contributor, and without partners or resource we will simply fail.  \n * We need accreditations - why would someone trust us with freight if we are not accredited -\n * We keep the own vehicles going different supplier and trial for two more months.\n * We need partners and suppliers to: [REDACTED NAME] and have the workload to: [REDACTED NAME] the arm we need whilst taking commercial risks and understanding commerciality, not job by job analysis.  \n\n \n\n3 If the answer is no\n\n * We salvage what business we have and want to: [REDACTED NAME] transfer or give notice\n * We commence processing now the human aspects\n\n \n\nThis is unfortunately the reality of how logistics work, with very fine margins, high work levels and little reward, a lot of business is won on costs alone, and is a good fit for primary work already in place.\n\n \n\nE: john@freightlink.co.uk\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\nJohn Gaskell\n\nHead Of Sales and Contract Logistics\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT]. Email Disclaimer | Privacy | Terms & Conditions\n\nAll business is transacted under the current edition of the BIFA Standard Trading Conditions.",

For the purpose of clarity, I wish to: [REDACTED NAME] record the following:\n\n• At no point have I requested, nor raised concerns, regarding my post-termination clauses with Freightlink Solutions.\n\n• This matter was initiated solely by an email from [REDACTED NAME], asking me to sign a post-termination clause to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n• Upon my non-acceptance of this request, the company proceeded with what I consider emotional blackmail by targeting my daughter, restricting her employment opportunities, career development, and even threatening her future employment, by a non-existent conflict of interest .\n\n• It was this action that prompted me, voluntarily, to: [REDACTED NAME] assurance limited to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nThat said, I confirm that the amended agreement you have now provided is broadly acceptable, subject to: [REDACTED NAME] changes for your review.\n\n \n\n * This must state it replaces Part 3 vi, by mutual agreement, for the 6-month term. \n\n * Freight links signature must also be on the document, to: [REDACTED NAME] will sign first. \n\n \n\n * Whilst you cannot place Katies name: [REDACTED NAME] contract, I would like to: [REDACTED NAME] and place on record, I reserve the right to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement,  should [REDACTED NAME] not be placed back onto normal duties immediately or her probation failed in a way I believe is another direct result of my choice to: [REDACTED NAME] business. \n\n \n\nI trust this clarifies my position and look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] matter constructively.\n\n \n\nKind regards,  \n\nJohn Gaskell\n\n \n\n \n\nSent from: [REDACTED NAME] Mac\n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Tuesday, 23 December 2025 at 14:27\nTo: John.

For the purpose of clarity, please can I confirm the company’s position.\n\n \n\nWe sent you 3 emails on Friday, each intended to: [REDACTED NAME] various requests you have made over the last few weeks and try and move the position forward. \n\n \n\nPost termination clauses\n\n \n\nIn response to: [REDACTED NAME] being comfortable with the existing post termination clauses, we provided you with two options:-  \n\n 1. We offered to produce a new document which would supersede your existing post termination clauses. The executive summary of that document was contained within my email sent on 19th December. You confirmed that you are unwilling to: [REDACTED NAME] this as an option.\n 2. On 17th December and again on 19th December, we sent over an agreement specifically listing the Freight Ferry competitors, which we would consider as direct competitors to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited. This agreement effectively limits the scope of the Post Termination clause by excluding freight forwarders and hauliers, meaning the business would not take any further action should you chose to join a business providing these services. You confirmed that you are unwilling to: [REDACTED NAME] this as an option.\n\nWe are committed to: [REDACTED NAME] matter. We have now made some further amendments to: [REDACTED NAME] document (number 2, attached) which we hope meets with your final satisfaction. Please could I ask you to: [REDACTED NAME] amended document. This document formalises what you have confirmed in email dated 21st December. If we received this signed document, this would also provide the business with assurances and remove any potential conflict of interest. Upon receiving this signed document, we would be delighted to: [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] she is able to: [REDACTED NAME] the weekend / evening shift cover with our Customer Services Team.\n\nHowever as detailed in my email on Friday, if we are unable to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement, we do still expect you to: [REDACTED NAME] the current restrictions. Any failure to: [REDACTED NAME] would amount to a breach of contract by you and your new employer and it would be open to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited to: [REDACTED NAME] action against both of you.\n\n 3. DSAR - We have received you email today. We will revert in due course. \n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: 12 [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of HR\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT].

I cannot sign this document. The entire process was intended to: [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] is treated as an individual employee and to: [REDACTED NAME], voluntarily, to: [REDACTED NAME] assurances that there is no current conflict of interest.\n\nTo: [REDACTED NAME], I have already provided an email listing the companies supplied by Freightlink that I will not be joining as an employee or competitor. This was offered in good faith to: [REDACTED NAME] and to: [REDACTED NAME] suggestion of conflict.\n\nThere is no “deal” to: [REDACTED NAME] here, nor any basis for an exchange of concessions. I am being asked to: [REDACTED NAME] additional and extended restrictions without any form of financial consideration or benefit. As it stands, the only beneficiaries of these proposed terms would be Freightlink, and I am not prepared to: [REDACTED NAME] an agreement on that basis.\n\nI remain willing to: [REDACTED NAME] assurances regarding conflict of interest, but I cannot agree to: [REDACTED NAME] outlined in your proposal.\n\n \n\nKind Regards, [REDACTED NAME] Outlook for Mac\n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Friday, 19 December 2025 at 17:01\nTo: John. C Gaskell <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Without prejudice -Subject to: [REDACTED NAME] John,\n\n \n\nThank you for speaking with [REDACTED NAME] earlier today.\n\n \n\nFirst of all, I wanted to: [REDACTED NAME] current contractual position to: [REDACTED NAME] uncertainty about your current restrictions. As you know, you have already signed an employment contract that includes a range of post-termination restrictions, including a 6 month non-compete clause. You have expressed concerns about referring to: [REDACTED NAME] the new agreement. However, you are still bound by the terms set out in your Employment Contract whether the new agreement expressly refers to: [REDACTED NAME] not. The only way the current restrictions can be varied is if we expressly agree to: [REDACTED NAME] the new agreement. Therefore, if we are unable to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement, we do still expect you to: [REDACTED NAME] the current restrictions. Any failure to: [REDACTED NAME] would amount to a breach of contract by you and your new employer and it would be open to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited to: [REDACTED NAME] action against both of you.   \n\n \n\nHowever, in light of your concerns and we are obviously very keen to: [REDACTED NAME] resolve things amicably, we would like to propose a new agreement (as discussed with [REDACTED NAME] on the phone earlier) which will replace the current restriction in your previous Employment Contract .\n\n \n\nThese are the key points which will form the new agreement:\n\n \n\n 1. Outline your willingness to: [REDACTED NAME] non-compete from: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME], in exchange for 12-month non-solicitation and non-deal obligations\n\n \n\n 2. Confirm that these restrictions will link to: [REDACTED NAME] date and are separate from: [REDACTED NAME] employment matters or other employees.\n\n \n\n 3. Include obligations around data deletion, confidentiality, and disclosure of restrictions to: [REDACTED NAME] employer.\n\n \n\n 4. We would include general obligations from: [REDACTED NAME] contract, such as the duty to disclose a copy of the new agreement restrictions to: [REDACTED NAME]/prospective employer and not to: [REDACTED NAME] out as being connected to: [REDACTED NAME] Ltd post-termination. We will also include an obligation for you to: [REDACTED NAME] in advance if you accept a job offer over the next 12 months. \n\n \n\n 5. Address previous discussions regarding DSAR and grievance, and confirm that these could be withdrawn as part of the agreement. Whilst you are entitled to: [REDACTED NAME] of these, during recent meetings you have suggested that if we can get the restrictions in a new agreement finalised, you would not pursue these. If that’s the case, we would include a clause in the agreement to: [REDACTED NAME] are withdrawing/not pursuing the DSAR and/or any grievance.\n\n \n\n 6. Offer a standard reference as part of the agreement\n\n \n\nIf you would like to: [REDACTED NAME] offer, please let us know by 10.00am on Monday 22 December and a new written agreement will be circulated next week for your review which would need to: [REDACTED NAME] off before you finish your employment.\n\n \n\nKind regards, [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: 12 [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of HR\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT].

There you will find the OAuth and the API Keys that can be generated.\n * Freightlink and UTA need to: [REDACTED NAME] use cases, with each party contributing their requirements.\n\nSome points to: [REDACTED NAME] for the use cases:\n\n * Card authorization for immediate bookings,\n * Cancellation of bookings,\n * Card authorization for future crossings,\n * Transaction file generation.\n\n(Our API Specification currently covers the first two scenarios: booking and crossing in the near future, as well as cancellations.)\n\n \n\nCustoms Link/Declarations:\n\n * There will be no registration fees for UTA customers accessing the customs link through UTA Ferry.\n * Declarations can be generated entirely (import, export) via the customs link, including future declarations such as SSGB, ENS, ELO, and ICS2.\n * Customs services will be available digitally for the following countries: UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Portugal. No on-site offices are involved.\n * John, could you please provide more information on additional customs services available to: [REDACTED NAME]?\n * John and I still need to: [REDACTED NAME] pricing and conditions.\n * [REDACTED NAME] will send an email regarding the new ELO declarations and a “How To” document for sales.\n\n \n\nSales Training:\n\n * Training sessions will be organized by region after we finalize the customs link and declarations in UTA Ferry.\n\n \n\nIn the UTA Ferry Portal:\n\n * Replace box 3 with the Irish Ferries offer.\n * Offer on Dover-Calais at [REDACTED AMOUNT] via Irish Ferries.\n * The offer on Dover-Calais and Dover-Dunkerque, including a free meal on board for [REDACTED AMOUNT] via DFDS, remains unchanged.\n * UTA will reactivate the conditions for Dover-Calais.\n\n \n\nOffers - John:\n\n * Irish Ferries\n * Price stages for the most popular routes\n * Customs services\n\n \n\nIntermodal Information:\n\n * I will clarify whether we are permitted to: [REDACTED NAME] unaccompanied service to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nUTA Tolls:\n\n * Support Freightlink with toll solutions for customers purchasing UTA toll boxes.\n\n \n\nMonthly Reporting:\n\n * Freightlink will generate monthly reports to: [REDACTED NAME] with UTA.\n\n \n\nCustomer Mass Communication:\n\n * Special offers and better rates on select routes\n * Customs declarations through UTA Ferry\n * Mandatory declarations\n\n \n\n \n\nAdditionally, in case you’ve changed your address due to: [REDACTED NAME] office, please send me your new address so we can update our systems and make a small amendment to: [REDACTED NAME]. I think it must be relevant also for when we receive invoices from Freightlink, that we update this information. Also, can the addendum be signed digitally via DocuSing? If so, can I add you, John, to: [REDACTED NAME] for Freightlink?\n\n \n\nA follow-up meeting at the end of September to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\n \n\nBest regards,\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] \n\nStrategic Partner Management\n\nPartner Manager Plus Services\nT/ + [REDACTED PHONE]-192\n\nM/ +49 [REDACTED PHONE]\n[REDACTED URL]\nUNION TANK Eckstein GmbH & Co.

Marimosa – it is understood that this matter may not need to: [REDACTED NAME] further.  We agreed on a fixed fee of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT for that work, which we would discount by the percentage corresponding to: [REDACTED NAME] option which you chose should you proceed with that.  We’d then translate that discounted figure into the corresponding number of hours at the discounted hourly rates under the retainer.  Put simply, if you opted for a 4 hour retainer then we would discount by 15% to [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT and at my hourly rate of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT under the retainer, this would equate to 4.5 hours.\n\n \n\n 2. T&Cs Update – I anticipate this taking no more than 1 hour of time, reviewing whether there are any consequential amendments required in addition to: [REDACTED NAME] required additional provisions regarding refunds and for certainty would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at this amount (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n 3. White Label Agreement – as mentioned, we created a form of WLA for CustomsLink to: [REDACTED NAME] relationship with the RHA and notwithstanding that this was a heavily negotiated document, we can utilise this as a starting point for creating a similar version for FLS.  There will be a degree of work to ‘decompile’ where we arrived with RHA and to: [REDACTED NAME] it properly suits the needs of FLS (meanwhile reviewing the other form of WLA which has been being used to: [REDACTED NAME] useful provisions).  I would estimate 6.5 – 7.5 hours but for certainty, would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at 7.5 hours (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nAs stated above, I have attached our retainer proposal.  As you’ll see, we have set out (Partner-led) options varying from 4 up to 10 hours per month with discounts on our normal hourly rates increasing, the more hours you opt for.  I would suggest that with a start date of 1 June, a 4 hour retainer may be of benefit at the outset if you did wish to: [REDACTED NAME] up and I would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] the Marimosa work and the above work into this in line with the hours stated.  I’d also wrap up our AS24 file and include any further work on that project within the retainer too from: [REDACTED NAME] forwards.  The attached should explain how the retainer works but as stated, you may roll over unused time and additional time would be charged at the discounted ‘additional rate’.  Under retainers, we raise our first invoice after 3 months so as to: [REDACTED NAME] the increased amount of initial work which we typically fine and ensure that you benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] value.\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME]\nSent: 09 May 2023 13:20\nTo: '[REDACTED NAME]' <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nHi [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nNoted and understood.  I have any time Monday or Tuesday AM next week if either of those work for you?  I’ll send round a Teams for whenever is convenient for you on those days.\n\n \n\nThanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 09 May 2023 12:35\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nThis Message originated outside your organization.",

As I indicated, it’s a lot more complex than a simple “sales source”. The different data capture points have grown over many years to: [REDACTED NAME] different requirements. I have tried to: [REDACTED NAME] of these and provide a breakdown.\n\n \n\nThe single closest thing we have to a single source of truth is Sales source. This is driven from: [REDACTED NAME] up in web / app > F2F2 > Account open > Sales input into a new tab in F2F2 manually. If the sales guys used this properly, we genuinely have a better picture. There are some fail safes in here to: [REDACTED NAME] stop sales manipulating the inbound sales and saying they converted it. I found generally they took an inbound call or rang an existing web/app account and then claimed a conversion,. Yes its sales….its farming not hunting. Appreciate we need both. I have been here many times with sales. When we scratch the surface, we discover some bending of the truths.\n\n \n\nI always encouraged sales to: [REDACTED NAME] sales on an annual basis to deliver +20% costs. The year prior sales then became a  “house account”. Hence the reason converted by “X” 2024 / 2025 etc so we could track individual performance in that year.  \n\n \n\nNot complaining, we have done this exercise last year when we tried to: [REDACTED NAME] to follow a process. The original doc Fiona produced is also attached.\n\n \n\nAgain, not complaining, this took me 1h 45m today to: [REDACTED NAME] get into the details and test the data. I hope this helps you get a better understanding. Ordinarily I know you would go to: [REDACTED NAME] this, but I said I would deliver.\n\n \n\nMy POV, I think we make do with what we have and use it as intended and tighten up the process, or we bend the existing structures for new uses as you and John see fit. NB doing the second will muddy historical reporting. It’s not impossible, but please be-aware of the limitations this path would deliver. The data capture is complex and ties into many threads. As you know later this year, we will be looking to integrate a CRM, I would suggest that’s the time to: [REDACTED NAME] change things.\n\n \n\nHowever this might be a bit disappointing in terms of change, I hope that’s all helpful.\n\n \n\nHappy to: [REDACTED NAME] when we both have time.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

Marimosa – it is understood that this matter may not need to: [REDACTED NAME] further.  We agreed on a fixed fee of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT for that work, which we would discount by the percentage corresponding to: [REDACTED NAME] option which you chose should you proceed with that.  We’d then translate that discounted figure into the corresponding number of hours at the discounted hourly rates under the retainer.  Put simply, if you opted for a 4 hour retainer then we would discount by 15% to [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT and at my hourly rate of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT under the retainer, this would equate to 4.5 hours.\n\n \n\n 2. T&Cs Update – I anticipate this taking no more than 1 hour of time, reviewing whether there are any consequential amendments required in addition to: [REDACTED NAME] required additional provisions regarding refunds and for certainty would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at this amount (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n 3. White Label Agreement – as mentioned, we created a form of WLA for CustomsLink to: [REDACTED NAME] relationship with the RHA and notwithstanding that this was a heavily negotiated document, we can utilise this as a starting point for creating a similar version for FLS.  There will be a degree of work to ‘decompile’ where we arrived with RHA and to: [REDACTED NAME] it properly suits the needs of FLS (meanwhile reviewing the other form of WLA which has been being used to: [REDACTED NAME] useful provisions).  I would estimate 6.5 – 7.5 hours but for certainty, would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at 7.5 hours (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nAs stated above, I have attached our retainer proposal.  As you’ll see, we have set out (Partner-led) options varying from 4 up to 10 hours per month with discounts on our normal hourly rates increasing, the more hours you opt for.  I would suggest that with a start date of 1 June, a 4 hour retainer may be of benefit at the outset if you did wish to: [REDACTED NAME] up and I would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] the Marimosa work and the above work into this in line with the hours stated.  I’d also wrap up our AS24 file and include any further work on that project within the retainer too from: [REDACTED NAME] forwards.  The attached should explain how the retainer works but as stated, you may roll over unused time and additional time would be charged at the discounted ‘additional rate’.  Under retainers, we raise our first invoice after 3 months so as to: [REDACTED NAME] the increased amount of initial work which we typically fine and ensure that you benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] value.\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] Pickervance\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME]\nSent: 09 May 2023 13:20\nTo: '[REDACTED NAME]' <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nHi [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nNoted and understood.  I have any time Monday or Tuesday AM next week if either of those work for you?  I’ll send round a Teams for whenever is convenient for you on those days.\n\n \n\nThanks, [REDACTED NAME] Pickervance\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 09 May 2023 12:35\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nThis Message originated outside your organization.",

However, instead of you working out your notice period, we have decided to: [REDACTED NAME] on garden leave from 20th October 2025 in accordance with clause 21 of your Employment Contract.\n\n \n\nThis means that you will continue to: [REDACTED NAME] pay and benefits (with the exception of benefits that are given to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] job, such as a work mobile phone or car allowance) in the normal way. You remain bound by all the obligations and restrictions set out in your Employment Contract, save the duty to: [REDACTED NAME]. You will not be allowed to: [REDACTED NAME] work and must stay away from: [REDACTED NAME] during the garden leave period. During the garden leave period, you are not permitted to: [REDACTED NAME] other employment and are required to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] by our organisation and to: [REDACTED NAME] work requested by our organisation.\n\n \n\nI would like to: [REDACTED NAME] that you are still bound by the obligations and restrictions set out in clauses below of your Employment Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, I set out below the clauses that apply:\n\n \n\n * Part 1, Clause 16: Confidential Information: You are strictly prohibited from disclosing, using, or retaining any confidential information acquired during the course of your employment. This obligation survives termination and is enforceable under both contractual and common law principles.\n * Part 1, Clause 21: Garden Leave: During any period of Garden Leave, you will remain an employee of the Company and bound by the terms of your contract. You must remain available to: [REDACTED NAME] any reasonable requests from: [REDACTED NAME], including attending meetings or providing information. All accrued unused holiday entitlement will be taken during Garden Leave. You must not contact: [REDACTED NAME] with the named parties in vii, or take alternative employment during Garden Leave without explicit consent from us.\n * Part 1, Clause 10 and Part 3: Post Termination Restrictions: Upon termination of your employment, you will be subject to: [REDACTED NAME] covenants set out in your contract, including but not limited to:\n   * Non-compete obligations prohibiting engagement in any business that competes with Freightlink Solutions Limited.\n   * Non-solicitation and non-dealing clauses relating to clients, customers, suppliers, and employees of the Company.\n * Conduct: You are expected to: [REDACTED NAME] conduct and refrain from: [REDACTED NAME] that may cause reputational, operational, or commercial harm to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited.\n\nAny breach of these obligations will be treated as a serious matter. Freightlink Solutions Limited reserves the right to: [REDACTED NAME] available legal remedies, including injunctive relief, damages, and costs, without further notice.\n\nThis letter is issued without prejudice to: [REDACTED NAME] or remedies the Company may have under contract or law.\n\nShould you have any questions regarding your obligations during garden leave, please XXXX.\n\nYours sincerely,",

C Gaskell <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 15 December 2025 11:50\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nCc: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) – Personal Data Access\n\n \n\nGood morning [REDACTED NAME],\n\nApologies for the delay in responding—I was awaiting further advice.\n\nWe will address each of the three matters separately rather than combining them into a single email.\n\nNon-Compete Agreement\n\nRegarding the non-compete agreement received, I am unable to: [REDACTED NAME] in its current form. The draft I briefly reviewed last Thursday included a defined time frame, whereas the version provided does not, and it also contains additional clauses that I did not propose or agree to.\n\nAs I am voluntarily entering into this agreement, I request the following amendments:\n\n * Removal of Sections 1, 2, and 3, as I did not agree to: [REDACTED NAME]. I remain aware of my existing contractual obligations, and this non-compete should serve only as an addition to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement.\n * Explicit statement that I am receiving no remuneration and that this agreement is voluntary.\n * A defined time limit, ending on 30 March 2026.\n * Clarification that I am signing to: [REDACTED NAME] and my daughter, [REDACTED NAME], ensuring normal working practices can continue and avoiding any conflict of interest.\n * Competitor companies must be specifically listed and limited to: [REDACTED NAME]. The current wording “not limited to” is too open to interpretation.\n * The agreement should become void upon Katie’s termination of employment, however that may occur during the stated period.\n * The scope must be restricted to: [REDACTED NAME] the Ferry, Rail, and Tunnel sectors of the business. Extending it to: [REDACTED NAME] operations leaves room for misinterpretation, particularly regarding freight forwarding or haulage companies.\n\nI will forward a copy of the email I previously sent for reference.\n\nDSAR\n\nOnce the above is resolved, I will advise on next steps. However, I reserve the right to exercise a DSAR in the future and will not sign any document that limits this right.\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nAt present, legal action remains only a potential consideration. A DSAR may be required to: [REDACTED NAME] further. I will not sign any document that prevents me from: [REDACTED NAME] action in the future, and I reserve all rights in this regard.\n\nI hope we can resolve these matters promptly.\n\nIm aware we are losing time as my employment terminates in 15 Days. \n\nKind regards, [REDACTED NAME] Outlook for Mac\n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Friday, 12 December 2025 at 11:46\nTo: John. C Gaskell <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nCc: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) – Personal Data Access\n\nGood morning John,\n\n \n\nThank you for your time yesterday, it was great to: [REDACTED NAME] too.\n\nI can confirm that our meeting was held on a \"without prejudice\" basis. During the discussion, we shared documents confirming the business’ intention to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] 2026, subject to: [REDACTED NAME] set out in the Development Plan provided to: [REDACTED NAME] 25 September 2025.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of the Non-Compete Agreement, which will provide Freightlink with confirmation that is no conflict of interest. I will send it via Signable immediately.\n\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] DSAR request, we will need written confirmation that you are withdrawing the request. You also confirmed you would provide written assurance that no further action will be taken against the business.\n\nKind regards, [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: 12 [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of HR\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT].

Please find attached.\n * Freightlink should share the email addresses required for accessing our API console. There you will find the OAuth and the API Keys that can be generated.\n * Freightlink and UTA need to: [REDACTED NAME] use cases, with each party contributing their requirements.\n\nSome points to: [REDACTED NAME] for the use cases:\n\n * Card authorization for immediate bookings,\n * Cancellation of bookings,\n * Card authorization for future crossings,\n * Transaction file generation.\n\n(Our API Specification currently covers the first two scenarios: booking and crossing in the near future, as well as cancellations.)\n\n \n\nCustoms Link/Declarations:\n\n * There will be no registration fees for UTA customers accessing the customs link through UTA Ferry.\n * Declarations can be generated entirely (import, export) via the customs link, including future declarations such as SSGB, ENS, ELO, and ICS2.\n * Customs services will be available digitally for the following countries: UK, Germany, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Portugal. No on-site offices are involved.\n * John, could you please provide more information on additional customs services available to: [REDACTED NAME]?\n * John and I still need to: [REDACTED NAME] pricing and conditions.\n * [REDACTED NAME] will send an email regarding the new ELO declarations and a “How To” document for sales.\n\n \n\nSales Training:\n\n * Training sessions will be organized by region after we finalize the customs link and declarations in UTA Ferry.\n\n \n\nIn the UTA Ferry Portal:\n\n * Replace box 3 with the Irish Ferries offer.\n * Offer on Dover-Calais at [REDACTED AMOUNT] via Irish Ferries.\n * The offer on Dover-Calais and Dover-Dunkerque, including a free meal on board for [REDACTED AMOUNT] via DFDS, remains unchanged.\n * UTA will reactivate the conditions for Dover-Calais.\n\n \n\nOffers - John:\n\n * Irish Ferries\n * Price stages for the most popular routes\n * Customs services\n\n \n\nIntermodal Information:\n\n * I will clarify whether we are permitted to: [REDACTED NAME] unaccompanied service to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nUTA Tolls:\n\n * Support Freightlink with toll solutions for customers purchasing UTA toll boxes.\n\n \n\nMonthly Reporting:\n\n * Freightlink will generate monthly reports to: [REDACTED NAME] with UTA.\n\n \n\nCustomer Mass Communication:\n\n * Special offers and better rates on select routes\n * Customs declarations through UTA Ferry\n * Mandatory declarations\n\n \n\n \n\nAdditionally, in case you’ve changed your address due to: [REDACTED NAME] office, please send me your new address so we can update our systems and make a small amendment to: [REDACTED NAME].

However, instead of you working out your notice period, we have decided to: [REDACTED NAME] on garden leave from 20th October 2025 in accordance with clause 21 of your Employment Contract.\n\n \n\nThis means that you will continue to: [REDACTED NAME] pay and benefits (with the exception of benefits that are given to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] job, such as a work mobile phone or car allowance) in the normal way. You remain bound by all the obligations and restrictions set out in your Employment Contract, save the duty to: [REDACTED NAME]. You will not be allowed to: [REDACTED NAME] work and must stay away from: [REDACTED NAME] during the garden leave period. During the garden leave period, you are not permitted to: [REDACTED NAME] other employment and are required to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] by our organisation and to: [REDACTED NAME] work requested by our organisation.\n\n \n\nI would like to: [REDACTED NAME] that you are still bound by the obligations and restrictions set out in clauses below of your Employment Contract. For the avoidance of doubt, I set out below the clauses that apply:\n\n \n\n * Part 1, Clause 16: Confidential Information: You are strictly prohibited from disclosing, using, or retaining any confidential information acquired during the course of your employment. This obligation survives termination and is enforceable under both contractual and common law principles.\n * Part 1, Clause 21: Garden Leave: During any period of Garden Leave, you will remain an employee of the Company and bound by the terms of your contract. You must remain available to: [REDACTED NAME] any reasonable requests from: [REDACTED NAME], including attending meetings or providing information. All accrued unused holiday entitlement will be taken during Garden Leave. You must not contact: [REDACTED NAME] with the named parties in vii, or take alternative employment during Garden Leave without explicit consent from us.\n * Part 1, Clause 10 and Part 3: Post Termination Restrictions: Upon termination of your employment, you will be subject to: [REDACTED NAME] covenants set out in your contract, including but not limited to:\n   * Non-compete obligations prohibiting engagement in any business that competes with Freightlink Solutions Limited.\n   * Non-solicitation and non-dealing clauses relating to clients, customers, suppliers, and employees of the Company.\n * Conduct: You are expected to: [REDACTED NAME] conduct and refrain from: [REDACTED NAME] that may cause reputational, operational, or commercial harm to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited.\n\nAny breach of these obligations will be treated as a serious matter. Freightlink Solutions Limited reserves the right to: [REDACTED NAME] available legal remedies, including injunctive relief, damages, and costs, without further notice.\n\nThis letter is issued without prejudice to: [REDACTED NAME] or remedies the Company may have under contract or law.\n\nShould you have any questions regarding your obligations during garden leave, please XXXX.\n\nYours sincerely,",

      "body": "Gents,\n\n \n\nAs times ticks on, I believe the role of commercial manager is becoming ever more critical to: [REDACTED NAME] in 2024+. As we go through the process and CV’s, the more I consider this conundrum. It becomes more and more apparent to: [REDACTED NAME] if we appoint the wrong person, [REDACTED NAME], closely followed by [REDACTED NAME], end up spending an increasing amount of time doing what you have both done for months which is backfilling [REDACTED NAME] role…whilst under increasing pressure. The role is that critical, failure means we really do apply pressure to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nIf we do make a good appointment, there is the fact that we will lose 3+ months as “X” learns the ropes. Equally [REDACTED NAME], one of your strong feelings was always to: [REDACTED NAME] touch with sales. This position weakens that link, and in fact, the new owner of that team, we as directors become increasingly more reliant on them to: [REDACTED NAME] results for 2024. It’s a tough ask for someone with industry knowledge let alone a newbie !\n\n \n\nI want to put a spotlight on the elephant. [REDACTED NAME]’s knowledge of “CUSTOMS” is very low (I am sure you will not mind me pointing this out). However, [REDACTED NAME] continues to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and the team to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. The no 1 problem we have in CL is SALES. [REDACTED NAME]’s engagement here is low to medium. To: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME], we have witnessed [REDACTED NAME] ratcheting the rhetoric with CL strategy. I must assume this is not just a [REDACTED NAME] thought. Equally we all agree CL holds the BIGGEST opportunity of the 3 pillars. With this, we need to find a way to: [REDACTED NAME] best, [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] chances of success.\n\n \n\nSo how do we DE-RISK the sales, and IMPROVE % OF SUCCESS & PERFORMANCE ??? Lets not take anything from: [REDACTED NAME], and I accept this is not an exact round peg in a round hole, but I think this rounds a square peg….it is not a finished product !\n\n \n\nSee Organogram PAGE 2\n\nAttached Headlines:-\n\n \n\n a. Help [REDACTED NAME] with a heavy weight – [REDACTED NAME] takes over managing CS and supports that unit. I have called here “office manager” so she can carry on with some of the tasks she manages now.\n b. Back fill Jens role with a relatively lower salaried project manager £ 30k - £ 35K – see (e)\n c. Decrease [REDACTED NAME]’s direct management reports to focus. In Q1, [REDACTED NAME] report to John (think that was the plan – so nothing new then)\n d. [REDACTED NAME] takes over Freightlink / CustomsLink sales inc partners – I think I have said this before, put the best, [REDACTED NAME] the best, [REDACTED NAME]. He has done this job prior to a very high standard, so this massively de-risks the business position. Yes the learning curve remains with CL sales, BUT [REDACTED NAME] is a accomplished sales professional.\n e. LUMPY BIT 1)[REDACTED NAME] takes back strategic responsibility of CustomsLink..OR…2)we have to: [REDACTED NAME] unicorn to: [REDACTED NAME] business forward.

E2 – the new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward, I am not 100% convinced [REDACTED NAME] could deliver this. He is good guy, I am not convinced [REDACTED NAME] is that and I think he is C 70K – his old job was £ 90k)\n h. WILD CARD – is there a better solution WITH John within the business ? I have run out of time to: [REDACTED NAME] one through – but smells like 70K ????\n\n \n\nI know in the past [REDACTED NAME] you have been uneasy with structure changes. I will be honest I don’t, If a team is not working as well as it could, change it in my view. I feel [REDACTED NAME] you worry about the Stena Line POV. My thoughts are IF any of the above sticks, we say nothing at the board meeting next week. When we visit in March, we tell them what we did to: [REDACTED NAME]. That shows good leadership.  \n\n \n\nFor our internal team, these are all comfortable changes with no sudden jolts that would concern me when speaking to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nGents 100% I am not being mischievous here.

      "body": "Hi [REDACTED NAME],\nThank you again for your time yesterday.\nAs discussed, due to a combination of factors, our volumes and gross profit will fall short of the 2025 budget. This unfortunately means we’re not in a position to: [REDACTED NAME] packages or costs at this time. The business is reliant on achieving its budget targets.\nWe shared our 2026 budget plans with you, which I trust you agree are realistic and take into account the challenges your team has faced this year. The budget reflects the current run rate with a 10% uplift, and you’ll also benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] work from: [REDACTED NAME] following John’s departure.\nYour continued commitment and support in delivering this plan is essential. You've made it clear that you do not wish to: [REDACTED NAME] hiring a new BDM at this stage, and we respect that decision. You know your clients and market better than anyone, and we support your approach. However, it’s vital that we see a clear recovery plan that drives growth.\nI was encouraged to: [REDACTED NAME] you and your team will take ownership of generating new sales. As you know, we’ve struggled to: [REDACTED NAME] this front in recent years, and we must avoid repeating that pattern in 2026.\nTo: [REDACTED NAME], we need to: [REDACTED NAME] a set of key KPIs that you and the team are fully aligned with. If we fall short of these KPIs, we must be prepared to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. We cannot afford to: [REDACTED NAME] a plan that isn’t delivering results. If something isn’t working, we need to: [REDACTED NAME]—quickly and decisively. \nThese KPIs will primarily focus on new business development and sales growth. Let’s work together to: [REDACTED NAME] have a robust framework in place to: [REDACTED NAME] drive performance. \nIn recognition of your support and the extra hard work you will undertake in 2026, we will adjust your package as follows:-\n\n\n * Current salary [REDACTED AMOUNT] plus bonus\n * Monthly bonus 2025 (amended immediately) on target [REDACTED AMOUNT] per month (as discussed [REDACTED NAME] will agree these with you)\n * 01st Jan 2026 [REDACTED AMOUNT] (10.5% / [REDACTED AMOUNT])\n\n\n\nFor 2026, we will also amend your monthly targets as follows. This provides you with an easier initial target to hit (on budget), plus the ability to: [REDACTED NAME] more bonus as your overachieve.\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nMonth GP\n\nQuarter GP\n\nAnnual GP\n\nAnnualised bonus if all achieved\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n5%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n10%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n20%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n30%\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n[REDACTED AMOUNT]\n\n \n\nThis is a substantial step forward and underlines our support of you. This must also be seen as a stepped change in not just your effort but your continued growth in professionalism. [REDACTED NAME], [REDACTED NAME] and myself are committed to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] achieve the above, but also your personal growth goals.\n\n\nBefore we put this increase formally in writing from: [REDACTED NAME], I would like you to: [REDACTED NAME] have your full commitment going forward. \n\n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\nT: + 44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\nW: www.freightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector",

If there is anything else we can do to: [REDACTED NAME] please speak up.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – I would like more breathing space, if we look at Aldi talks nobody has got too exited about this one this is ideal and hopefully we can deliver. I have also been chasing up leads that other people have been working on, examples provided include John on Reload and [REDACTED NAME] from: [REDACTED NAME] the ATA carnets. Furthermore, completing the demo’s are taking too much of my time up, I can be waiting 20-30 minutes and then nobody turns up.\n\n[REDACTED NAME] -  Agree to: [REDACTED NAME] these areas and will discuss with JG and the UK FL Sales Team to: [REDACTED NAME] communication.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – Mentioned you look at those inbound demo bookings and take your pick of what can/cant do and if your time is best, [REDACTED NAME] speak with [REDACTED NAME] and ask if [REDACTED NAME] can complete.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – Ok will do that would help.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – Any further comments from: [REDACTED NAME]?\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – I completely echo what [REDACTED NAME] has said, I enjoy working with you but improvements must be made going forward to: [REDACTED NAME] increase in the pipeline.\n\n \n\n \n\n 6.

We absolutely believe you are the right person to: [REDACTED NAME]. If there is anything else we can do to: [REDACTED NAME] please speak up.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – I would like more breathing space, if we look at Aldi talks nobody has got too exited about this one this is ideal and hopefully we can deliver. I have also been chasing up leads that other people have been working on, examples provided include John on Reload and [REDACTED NAME] from: [REDACTED NAME] the ATA carnets. Furthermore, completing the demo’s are taking too much of my time up, I can be waiting 20-30 minutes and then nobody turns up.\n\n[REDACTED NAME] -  Agree to: [REDACTED NAME] these areas and will discuss with JG and the UK FL Sales Team to: [REDACTED NAME] communication.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – Mentioned you look at those inbound demo bookings and take your pick of what can/cant do and if your time is best, [REDACTED NAME] speak with [REDACTED NAME] and ask if [REDACTED NAME] can complete.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – Ok will do that would help.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – Any further comments from: [REDACTED NAME]?\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME] – I completely echo what [REDACTED NAME] has said, I enjoy working with you but improvements must be made going forward to: [REDACTED NAME] increase in the pipeline.\n\n \n\n \n\n 6. AOB\n\n \n\nNothing else to discuss.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs outlined, we are committed to: [REDACTED NAME] and I have attached the successful completion of your probation letter for use with your mortgage supplier.

Marimosa – it is understood that this matter may not need to: [REDACTED NAME] further.  We agreed on a fixed fee of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT for that work, which we would discount by the percentage corresponding to: [REDACTED NAME] option which you chose should you proceed with that.  We’d then translate that discounted figure into the corresponding number of hours at the discounted hourly rates under the retainer.  Put simply, if you opted for a 4 hour retainer then we would discount by 15% to [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT and at my hourly rate of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT under the retainer, this would equate to 4.5 hours.\n\n \n\n 2. T&Cs Update – I anticipate this taking no more than 1 hour of time, reviewing whether there are any consequential amendments required in addition to: [REDACTED NAME] required additional provisions regarding refunds and for certainty would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at this amount (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n 3. White Label Agreement – as mentioned, we created a form of WLA for CustomsLink to: [REDACTED NAME] relationship with the RHA and notwithstanding that this was a heavily negotiated document, we can utilise this as a starting point for creating a similar version for FLS.  There will be a degree of work to ‘decompile’ where we arrived with RHA and to: [REDACTED NAME] it properly suits the needs of FLS (meanwhile reviewing the other form of WLA which has been being used to: [REDACTED NAME] useful provisions).  I would estimate 6.5 – 7.5 hours but for certainty, would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at 7.5 hours (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nAs stated above, I have attached our retainer proposal.  As you’ll see, we have set out (Partner-led) options varying from 4 up to 10 hours per month with discounts on our normal hourly rates increasing, the more hours you opt for.  I would suggest that with a start date of 1 June, a 4 hour retainer may be of benefit at the outset if you did wish to: [REDACTED NAME] up and I would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] the Marimosa work and the above work into this in line with the hours stated.  I’d also wrap up our AS24 file and include any further work on that project within the retainer too from: [REDACTED NAME] forwards.  The attached should explain how the retainer works but as stated, you may roll over unused time and additional time would be charged at the discounted ‘additional rate’.  Under retainers, we raise our first invoice after 3 months so as to: [REDACTED NAME] the increased amount of initial work which we typically fine and ensure that you benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] value.\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME]\nSent: 09 May 2023 13:20\nTo: '[REDACTED NAME]' <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nHi [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nNoted and understood.  I have any time Monday or Tuesday AM next week if either of those work for you?  I’ll send round a Teams for whenever is convenient for you on those days.\n\n \n\nThanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 09 May 2023 12:35\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nThis Message originated outside your organization.",

Marimosa – it is understood that this matter may not need to: [REDACTED NAME] further.  We agreed on a fixed fee of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT for that work, which we would discount by the percentage corresponding to: [REDACTED NAME] option which you chose should you proceed with that.  We’d then translate that discounted figure into the corresponding number of hours at the discounted hourly rates under the retainer.  Put simply, if you opted for a 4 hour retainer then we would discount by 15% to [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT and at my hourly rate of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT under the retainer, this would equate to 4.5 hours.\n\n \n\n 2. T&Cs Update – I anticipate this taking no more than 1 hour of time, reviewing whether there are any consequential amendments required in addition to: [REDACTED NAME] required additional provisions regarding refunds and for certainty would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at this amount (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n 3. White Label Agreement – as mentioned, we created a form of WLA for CustomsLink to: [REDACTED NAME] relationship with the RHA and notwithstanding that this was a heavily negotiated document, we can utilise this as a starting point for creating a similar version for FLS.  There will be a degree of work to ‘decompile’ where we arrived with RHA and to: [REDACTED NAME] it properly suits the needs of FLS (meanwhile reviewing the other form of WLA which has been being used to: [REDACTED NAME] useful provisions).  I would estimate 6.5 – 7.5 hours but for certainty, would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at 7.5 hours (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nAs stated above, I have attached our retainer proposal.  As you’ll see, we have set out (Partner-led) options varying from 4 up to 10 hours per month with discounts on our normal hourly rates increasing, the more hours you opt for.  I would suggest that with a start date of 1 June, a 4 hour retainer may be of benefit at the outset if you did wish to: [REDACTED NAME] up and I would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] the Marimosa work and the above work into this in line with the hours stated.  I’d also wrap up our AS24 file and include any further work on that project within the retainer too from: [REDACTED NAME] forwards.  The attached should explain how the retainer works but as stated, you may roll over unused time and additional time would be charged at the discounted ‘additional rate’.  Under retainers, we raise our first invoice after 3 months so as to: [REDACTED NAME] the increased amount of initial work which we typically fine and ensure that you benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] value.\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] Pickervance\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME]\nSent: 09 May 2023 13:20\nTo: '[REDACTED NAME]' <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nHi [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nNoted and understood.  I have any time Monday or Tuesday AM next week if either of those work for you?  I’ll send round a Teams for whenever is convenient for you on those days.\n\n \n\nThanks, [REDACTED NAME] Pickervance\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 09 May 2023 12:35\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nThis Message originated outside your organization.",

Easy way forward, there simply wasn’t any effort.\n\n * We need a team that will deliver.\n * I need to: [REDACTED NAME] from: [REDACTED NAME] SMT and any other duties.\n * We need to: [REDACTED NAME] design tools similar to: [REDACTED NAME] – we don’t do this whatsoever or at least on a competitive scale.\n * This will take time and if the above isn’t in place it simply cannot be done.\n * Costs will be a major contributor, and without partners or resource we will simply fail.  \n * We need accreditations - why would someone trust us with freight if we are not accredited -\n * We keep the own vehicles going different supplier and trial for two more months.\n * We need partners and suppliers to: [REDACTED NAME] and have the workload to: [REDACTED NAME] the arm we need whilst taking commercial risks and understanding commerciality, not job by job analysis.  \n\n \n\n3 If the answer is no\n\n * We salvage what business we have and want to: [REDACTED NAME] transfer or give notice\n * We commence processing now the human aspects\n\n \n\nThis is unfortunately the reality of how logistics work, with very fine margins, high work levels and little reward, a lot of business is won on costs alone, and is a good fit for primary work already in place.\n\n \n\nE: john@freightlink.co.uk\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\nJohn Gaskell\n\nHead Of Sales and Contract Logistics\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT]. Email Disclaimer | Privacy | Terms & Conditions\n\nAll business is transacted under the current edition of the BIFA Standard Trading Conditions.",

The draft I briefly reviewed last Thursday included a defined time frame, whereas the version provided does not, and it also contains additional clauses that I did not propose or agree to.\n\nAs I am voluntarily entering into this agreement, I request the following amendments:\n\n * Removal of Sections 1, 2, and 3, as I did not agree to: [REDACTED NAME]. I remain aware of my existing contractual obligations, and this non-compete should serve only as an addition to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement.\n * Explicit statement that I am receiving no remuneration and that this agreement is voluntary.\n * A defined time limit, ending on 30 March 2026.\n * Clarification that I am signing to: [REDACTED NAME] and my daughter, [REDACTED NAME], ensuring normal working practices can continue and avoiding any conflict of interest.\n * Competitor companies must be specifically listed and limited to: [REDACTED NAME]. The current wording “not limited to” is too open to interpretation.\n * The agreement should become void upon Katie’s termination of employment, however that may occur during the stated period.\n * The scope must be restricted to: [REDACTED NAME] the Ferry, Rail, and Tunnel sectors of the business. Extending it to: [REDACTED NAME] operations leaves room for misinterpretation, particularly regarding freight forwarding or haulage companies.\n\nI will forward a copy of the email I previously sent for reference.\n\nDSAR\n\nOnce the above is resolved, I will advise on next steps. However, I reserve the right to exercise a DSAR in the future and will not sign any document that limits this right.\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nAt present, legal action remains only a potential consideration. A DSAR may be required to: [REDACTED NAME] further. I will not sign any document that prevents me from: [REDACTED NAME] action in the future, and I reserve all rights in this regard.\n\nI hope we can resolve these matters promptly.\n\nIm aware we are losing time as my employment terminates in 15 Days. \n\nKind regards, [REDACTED NAME] Outlook for Mac\n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Friday, 12 December 2025 at 11:46\nTo: John.

I will send it via Signable immediately.\n\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] DSAR request, we will need written confirmation that you are withdrawing the request.

Marimosa – it is understood that this matter may not need to: [REDACTED NAME] further.  We agreed on a fixed fee of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT for that work, which we would discount by the percentage corresponding to: [REDACTED NAME] option which you chose should you proceed with that.  We’d then translate that discounted figure into the corresponding number of hours at the discounted hourly rates under the retainer.  Put simply, if you opted for a 4 hour retainer then we would discount by 15% to [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT and at my hourly rate of [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT under the retainer, this would equate to 4.5 hours.\n\n \n\n 2. T&Cs Update – I anticipate this taking no more than 1 hour of time, reviewing whether there are any consequential amendments required in addition to: [REDACTED NAME] required additional provisions regarding refunds and for certainty would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at this amount (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n 3. White Label Agreement – as mentioned, we created a form of WLA for CustomsLink to: [REDACTED NAME] relationship with the RHA and notwithstanding that this was a heavily negotiated document, we can utilise this as a starting point for creating a similar version for FLS.  There will be a degree of work to ‘decompile’ where we arrived with RHA and to: [REDACTED NAME] it properly suits the needs of FLS (meanwhile reviewing the other form of WLA which has been being used to: [REDACTED NAME] useful provisions).  I would estimate 6.5 – 7.5 hours but for certainty, would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] at 7.5 hours (and therefore [REDACTED AMOUNT] + VAT).  Under the 4 hour retainer, this would benefit from a 15% discount.\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nAs stated above, I have attached our retainer proposal.  As you’ll see, we have set out (Partner-led) options varying from 4 up to 10 hours per month with discounts on our normal hourly rates increasing, the more hours you opt for.  I would suggest that with a start date of 1 June, a 4 hour retainer may be of benefit at the outset if you did wish to: [REDACTED NAME] up and I would be happy to: [REDACTED NAME] the Marimosa work and the above work into this in line with the hours stated.  I’d also wrap up our AS24 file and include any further work on that project within the retainer too from: [REDACTED NAME] forwards.  The attached should explain how the retainer works but as stated, you may roll over unused time and additional time would be charged at the discounted ‘additional rate’.  Under retainers, we raise our first invoice after 3 months so as to: [REDACTED NAME] the increased amount of initial work which we typically fine and ensure that you benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] value.\n\n \n\nI look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] you.\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME]\nSent: 09 May 2023 13:20\nTo: '[REDACTED NAME]' <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nHi [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\nNoted and understood.  I have any time Monday or Tuesday AM next week if either of those work for you?  I’ll send round a Teams for whenever is convenient for you on those days.\n\n \n\nThanks, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\nPartner, Head of Commercial\n\nT: DD [REDACTED PHONE] M [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nWeb: [REDACTED URL].uk\n\nTwitter: @forbessolicitor\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 09 May 2023 12:35\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Freightlink Development & support contract (F-MIS9/159)\n\n \n\nThis Message originated outside your organization.",

For the purpose of clarity, I wish to: [REDACTED NAME] record the following:\n\n• At no point have I requested, nor raised concerns, regarding my post-termination clauses with Freightlink Solutions.\n\n• This matter was initiated solely by an email from [REDACTED NAME], asking me to sign a post-termination clause to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n• Upon my non-acceptance of this request, the company proceeded with what I consider emotional blackmail by targeting my daughter, restricting her employment opportunities, career development, and even threatening her future employment, by a non-existent conflict of interest .\n\n• It was this action that prompted me, voluntarily, to: [REDACTED NAME] assurance limited to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nThat said, I confirm that the amended agreement you have now provided is broadly acceptable, subject to: [REDACTED NAME] changes for your review.\n\n \n\n * This must state it replaces Part 3 vi, by mutual agreement, for the 6-month term. \n\n * Freight links signature must also be on the document, to: [REDACTED NAME] will sign first. \n\n \n\n * Whilst you cannot place Katies name: [REDACTED NAME] contract, I would like to: [REDACTED NAME] and place on record, I reserve the right to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement,  should [REDACTED NAME] not be placed back onto normal duties immediately or her probation failed in a way I believe is another direct result of my choice to: [REDACTED NAME] business. \n\n \n\nI trust this clarifies my position and look forward to: [REDACTED NAME] matter constructively.\n\n \n\nKind regards,  \n\nJohn Gaskell\n\n \n\n \n\nSent from: [REDACTED NAME] Mac\n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Tuesday, 23 December 2025 at 14:27\nTo: John. C Gaskell <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nCc: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: RE: Without prejudice -Subject to: [REDACTED NAME] John,\n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME] email. For the purpose of clarity, please can I confirm the company’s position.\n\n \n\nWe sent you 3 emails on Friday, each intended to: [REDACTED NAME] various requests you have made over the last few weeks and try and move the position forward. \n\n \n\nPost termination clauses\n\n \n\nIn response to: [REDACTED NAME] being comfortable with the existing post termination clauses, we provided you with two options:-  \n\n 1. We offered to produce a new document which would supersede your existing post termination clauses. The executive summary of that document was contained within my email sent on 19th December. You confirmed that you are unwilling to: [REDACTED NAME] this as an option.\n 2. On 17th December and again on 19th December, we sent over an agreement specifically listing the Freight Ferry competitors, which we would consider as direct competitors to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited. This agreement effectively limits the scope of the Post Termination clause by excluding freight forwarders and hauliers, meaning the business would not take any further action should you chose to join a business providing these services. You confirmed that you are unwilling to: [REDACTED NAME] this as an option.\n\nWe are committed to: [REDACTED NAME] matter. We have now made some further amendments to: [REDACTED NAME] document (number 2, attached) which we hope meets with your final satisfaction. Please could I ask you to: [REDACTED NAME] amended document. This document formalises what you have confirmed in email dated 21st December. If we received this signed document, this would also provide the business with assurances and remove any potential conflict of interest. Upon receiving this signed document, we would be delighted to: [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] she is able to: [REDACTED NAME] the weekend / evening shift cover with our Customer Services Team.\n\nHowever as detailed in my email on Friday, if we are unable to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement, we do still expect you to: [REDACTED NAME] the current restrictions. Any failure to: [REDACTED NAME] would amount to a breach of contract by you and your new employer and it would be open to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited to: [REDACTED NAME] action against both of you.\n\n 3. DSAR - We have received you email today. We will revert in due course. \n\n \n\nMany thanks, [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: 12 [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of HR\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT].

C Gaskell <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSent: 21 December 2025 23:20\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Re: Without prejudice -Subject to: [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] \n\nThank you for your email.\n\n \n\nAfter reviewing the proposed terms, I need to: [REDACTED NAME] position clear. I cannot sign this document. The entire process was intended to: [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME] is treated as an individual employee and to: [REDACTED NAME], voluntarily, to: [REDACTED NAME] assurances that there is no current conflict of interest.\n\nTo: [REDACTED NAME], I have already provided an email listing the companies supplied by Freightlink that I will not be joining as an employee or competitor. This was offered in good faith to: [REDACTED NAME] and to: [REDACTED NAME] suggestion of conflict.\n\nThere is no “deal” to: [REDACTED NAME] here, nor any basis for an exchange of concessions. I am being asked to: [REDACTED NAME] additional and extended restrictions without any form of financial consideration or benefit. As it stands, the only beneficiaries of these proposed terms would be Freightlink, and I am not prepared to: [REDACTED NAME] an agreement on that basis.\n\nI remain willing to: [REDACTED NAME] assurances regarding conflict of interest, but I cannot agree to: [REDACTED NAME] outlined in your proposal.\n\n \n\nKind Regards, [REDACTED NAME] Outlook for Mac\n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Friday, 19 December 2025 at 17:01\nTo: John. C Gaskell <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Without prejudice -Subject to: [REDACTED NAME] John,\n\n \n\nThank you for speaking with [REDACTED NAME] earlier today.\n\n \n\nFirst of all, I wanted to: [REDACTED NAME] current contractual position to: [REDACTED NAME] uncertainty about your current restrictions. As you know, you have already signed an employment contract that includes a range of post-termination restrictions, including a 6 month non-compete clause. You have expressed concerns about referring to: [REDACTED NAME] the new agreement. However, you are still bound by the terms set out in your Employment Contract whether the new agreement expressly refers to: [REDACTED NAME] not. The only way the current restrictions can be varied is if we expressly agree to: [REDACTED NAME] the new agreement. Therefore, if we are unable to: [REDACTED NAME] agreement, we do still expect you to: [REDACTED NAME] the current restrictions. Any failure to: [REDACTED NAME] would amount to a breach of contract by you and your new employer and it would be open to: [REDACTED NAME] Limited to: [REDACTED NAME] action against both of you.   \n\n \n\nHowever, in light of your concerns and we are obviously very keen to: [REDACTED NAME] resolve things amicably, we would like to propose a new agreement (as discussed with [REDACTED NAME] on the phone earlier) which will replace the current restriction in your previous Employment Contract .\n\n \n\nThese are the key points which will form the new agreement:\n\n \n\n 1. Outline your willingness to: [REDACTED NAME] non-compete from: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME], in exchange for 12-month non-solicitation and non-deal obligations\n\n \n\n 2. Confirm that these restrictions will link to: [REDACTED NAME] date and are separate from: [REDACTED NAME] employment matters or other employees.\n\n \n\n 3. Include obligations around data deletion, confidentiality, and disclosure of restrictions to: [REDACTED NAME] employer.\n\n \n\n 4. We would include general obligations from: [REDACTED NAME] contract, such as the duty to disclose a copy of the new agreement restrictions to: [REDACTED NAME]/prospective employer and not to: [REDACTED NAME] out as being connected to: [REDACTED NAME] Ltd post-termination. We will also include an obligation for you to: [REDACTED NAME] in advance if you accept a job offer over the next 12 months. \n\n \n\n 5. Address previous discussions regarding DSAR and grievance, and confirm that these could be withdrawn as part of the agreement. Whilst you are entitled to: [REDACTED NAME] of these, during recent meetings you have suggested that if we can get the restrictions in a new agreement finalised, you would not pursue these. If that’s the case, we would include a clause in the agreement to: [REDACTED NAME] are withdrawing/not pursuing the DSAR and/or any grievance.\n\n \n\n 6. Offer a standard reference as part of the agreement\n\n \n\nIf you would like to: [REDACTED NAME] offer, please let us know by 10.00am on Monday 22 December and a new written agreement will be circulated next week for your review which would need to: [REDACTED NAME] off before you finish your employment.\n\n \n\nKind regards, [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nE: [REDACTED EMAIL]\n\nT: [REDACTED PHONE]\n\nW: freightlink.co.uk\n\nA: 12 [REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nHead of HR\n\n \n\nCompany registration number [REDACTED REF] | [REDACTED VAT].

      "body": "Many thanks, [REDACTED NAME] your time today during the brief business standup. Whilst we are still finalising the final figures, we are quietly confident we hit budget again last month. If confirmed this will be a fantastic result for the business…well done everyone ! SALES There is work to: [REDACTED NAME] in some of our ferry markets that were slightly short of budgets, but we are within touching distance. That final effort from: [REDACTED NAME] customer service to: [REDACTED NAME] bookings will make difference...so well done and keep up the hard work. CUSTOMER SERVICE After the success of CustomsLink offshore team, we have planned to: [REDACTED NAME] team further with 3 new team members to: [REDACTED NAME] amazing work that the Customer Service team deliver. This new team will focus on ENS and portpasses in preparation for ICS and ELO. We are now live with the new Sales / Customer service / CustomsLink dial function. This will improve the user experience for our clients, so they can contact sales, customer service and CustomsLink directly from: [REDACTED NAME] board. RELOAD After a successful Q1 and Q2, there is work to: [REDACTED NAME] with Reload, which [REDACTED NAME] and the team are looking to deliver. The results will come guys, keep going. CONTRACT LOGISTICS John and Contract Logistics are working hard to: [REDACTED NAME] ways of working with the dedicated vehicles. The existing forwarding volumes remain strong, with preparations for Q4 underway. MARKETING Marketing efforts continue to: [REDACTED NAME] results to: [REDACTED NAME] sales enquiries and bookings for both CustomsLink and Freightlink. The guys are hard at work looking at new ways to: [REDACTED NAME] clients better understand the complexities of ENS and portpasses and Customs. Standby for more news. Keep going guys…great work. DVELOPMENT The development team are laser focused on delivering ICS2 upgrades, and whilst ELO has been delayed, we want to: [REDACTED NAME] for the 1st Sept, even if this is a manual process unto French authorities confirm our API. Whilst this will provide added complexities for our clients, this gives us additional commercial opportunity to: [REDACTED NAME] clients. The dev team are also delivering some further upgrades to the Appv2, and the customs customer user experience, SMS service and a new mapping product. In the next 2 weeks, [REDACTED NAME] will be providing a monthly update with software release dates. CUSTOMSLINK CustomsLink has had another great month above budget, and the busiest month for Princes foods, so well done to: [REDACTED NAME] team. As reported, our ISO9XXXX was successful, so a big well done to: [REDACTED NAME] were involved. In other good news, [REDACTED NAME] coming back will give the team a real shot in the arm to: [REDACTED NAME] the platform and support the wider operations team....welcome back Dan. OPERATIONS The operations teams are now back to: [REDACTED NAME] now [REDACTED NAME] is back, let’s all remember how large our data base is approx. XXXXXXX which is a herculean task to: [REDACTED NAME] top of this number of schedules and pricing for over 9000 clients! That’s more than many ferry companies. This relies upon all the teams helping them keep the data current, so please consider our agreed OLA’s. Thank you for your patience at times. ACCOUNTS The accounts team are seeing the benefits of [REDACTED NAME] back in credit control and [REDACTED NAME] as xxxxxx who has supercharged the teams processing power. Great to: [REDACTED NAME] accounts team finally building a new team, ready for our future growth. HR [REDACTED NAME] is currently enjoying a well-earned break, and will no doubt return with a tan a smile and the normal high standard of HR support for the whole business. Meanwhile [REDACTED NAME] is doing a sterling job of developing her own skills supporting [REDACTED NAME] and the wider HR function, whilst also having a foot planted in the operations team. OFFICE MOVE [REDACTED NAME] is heavily involved with helping [REDACTED NAME] and I deliver the office move. We have another week or so effort to: [REDACTED NAME] office move. [REDACTED NAME] will provide an update in her weekly bulletin. [REDACTED NAME] and I would like to: [REDACTED NAME] all for all your immense hard work. The office move sees Freightlink and CustomsLink open a brand-new chapter of opportunity to: [REDACTED NAME] a team. PS there could also be some little surprises coming your way from [REDACTED NAME] &amp; the business. That last phone call for sales, the last conformation to a customer, that last declaration successfully completed, all add up. If we all deliver that little extra push, it adds up a big leap forwards.",

      "body": "Hi [REDACTED NAME],\n\n \n\nAs discussed in SMM attached is a breakdown of the Sales sources and other descriptions we use. As I indicated, it’s a lot more complex than a simple “sales source”. The different data capture points have grown over many years to: [REDACTED NAME] different requirements. I have tried to: [REDACTED NAME] of these and provide a breakdown.\n\n \n\nThe single closest thing we have to a single source of truth is Sales source. This is driven from: [REDACTED NAME] up in web / app > F2F2 > Account open > Sales input into a new tab in F2F2 manually. If the sales guys used this properly, we genuinely have a better picture. There are some fail safes in here to: [REDACTED NAME] stop sales manipulating the inbound sales and saying they converted it. I found generally they took an inbound call or rang an existing web/app account and then claimed a conversion,. Yes its sales….its farming not hunting. Appreciate we need both. I have been here many times with sales. When we scratch the surface, we discover some bending of the truths.\n\n \n\nI always encouraged sales to: [REDACTED NAME] sales on an annual basis to deliver +20% costs. The year prior sales then became a  “house account”. Hence the reason converted by “X” 2024 / 2025 etc so we could track individual performance in that year.  \n\n \n\nNot complaining, we have done this exercise last year when we tried to: [REDACTED NAME] to follow a process. The original doc [REDACTED NAME] produced is also attached.\n\n \n\nAgain, not complaining, this took me 1h 45m today to: [REDACTED NAME] get into the details and test the data. I hope this helps you get a better understanding. Ordinarily I know you would go to: [REDACTED NAME] this, but I said I would deliver.\n\n \n\nMy POV, I think we make do with what we have and use it as intended and tighten up the process, or we bend the existing structures for new uses as you and John see fit. NB doing the second will muddy historical reporting. It’s not impossible, but please be-aware of the limitations this path would deliver. The data capture is complex and ties into many threads. As you know later this year, we will be looking to integrate a CRM, I would suggest that’s the time to: [REDACTED NAME] change things.\n\n \n\nHowever this might be a bit disappointing in terms of change, I hope that’s all helpful.\n\n \n\nHappy to: [REDACTED NAME] when we both have time.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

      "body": "Just to: [REDACTED NAME] in the loop – I think [REDACTED NAME] will feel VERY VERY sore at this proposal.\n\n \n\nAdded to which I am sticking to: [REDACTED NAME] re Super Cargo which I think he feels undermines him, it’s a tricky moment in time.\n\n \n\nBR\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n \n\nFrom: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nDate: Tuesday, 21 November 2023 at 22:22\nTo: [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>, [REDACTED NAME] <[REDACTED EMAIL]>\nSubject: Commercial role\n\nGents,\n\n \n\nAs times ticks on, I believe the role of commercial manager is becoming ever more critical to: [REDACTED NAME] in 2024+. As we go through the process and CV’s, the more I consider this conundrum. It becomes more and more apparent to: [REDACTED NAME] if we appoint the wrong person, [REDACTED NAME], closely followed by [REDACTED NAME], end up spending an increasing amount of time doing what you have both done for months which is backfilling [REDACTED NAME] role…whilst under increasing pressure. The role is that critical, failure means we really do apply pressure to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nIf we do make a good appointment, there is the fact that we will lose 3+ months as “X” learns the ropes. Equally [REDACTED NAME], one of your strong feelings was always to: [REDACTED NAME] touch with sales. This position weakens that link, and in fact, the new owner of that team, we as directors become increasingly more reliant on them to: [REDACTED NAME] results for 2024. It’s a tough ask for someone with industry knowledge let alone a newbie !\n\n \n\nI want to put a spotlight on the elephant. [REDACTED NAME]’s knowledge of “CUSTOMS” is very low (I am sure you will not mind me pointing this out). However, [REDACTED NAME] continues to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and the team to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. The no 1 problem we have in CL is SALES. [REDACTED NAME]’s engagement here is low to medium. To: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME], we have witnessed [REDACTED NAME] ratcheting the rhetoric with CL strategy. I must assume this is not just a [REDACTED NAME] thought. Equally we all agree CL holds the BIGGEST opportunity of the 3 pillars. With this, we need to find a way to: [REDACTED NAME] best, [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] chances of success.\n\n \n\nSo how do we DE-RISK the sales, and IMPROVE % OF SUCCESS & PERFORMANCE ??? Lets not take anything from: [REDACTED NAME], and I accept this is not an exact round peg in a round hole, but I think this rounds a square peg….it is not a finished product !\n\n \n\nSee Organogram PAGE 2\n\nAttached Headlines:-\n\n \n\n a. Help [REDACTED NAME] with a heavy weight – [REDACTED NAME] takes over managing CS and supports that unit. I have called here “office manager” so she can carry on with some of the tasks she manages now.\n b. Back fill [REDACTED NAME] role with a relatively lower salaried project manager £ 30k - £ 35K – see (e)\n c. Decrease [REDACTED NAME]’s direct management reports to focus. In Q1, [REDACTED NAME] report to John (think that was the plan – so nothing new then)\n d. [REDACTED NAME] takes over Freightlink / CustomsLink sales inc partners – I think I have said this before, put the best, [REDACTED NAME] the best, [REDACTED NAME]. He has done this job prior to a very high standard, so this massively de-risks the business position. Yes the learning curve remains with CL sales, BUT [REDACTED NAME] is a accomplished sales professional.\n e. LUMPY BIT 1)[REDACTED NAME] takes back strategic responsibility of CustomsLink..OR…2)we have to: [REDACTED NAME] unicorn to: [REDACTED NAME] business forward. If (2) delivers better performance, at this stage we cancel (b) above, [REDACTED NAME] will pick this up, and the digital has to manage. I think this is viable NOW, but when I am removed, it probably needs that skill.\n f. I don’t have a finalised vision of e2 (new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward.\n g. E2 – the new role to: [REDACTED NAME] forward, I am not 100% convinced [REDACTED NAME] could deliver this. He is good guy, I am not convinced [REDACTED NAME] is that and I think he is C 70K – his old job was £ 90k)\n h. WILD CARD – is there a better solution WITH John within the business ? I have run out of time to: [REDACTED NAME] one through – but smells like 70K ????\n\n \n\nI know in the past [REDACTED NAME] you have been uneasy with structure changes. I will be honest I don’t, If a team is not working as well as it could, change it in my view. I feel [REDACTED NAME] you worry about the Stena Line POV. My thoughts are IF any of the above sticks, we say nothing at the board meeting next week. When we visit in March, we tell them what we did to: [REDACTED NAME]. That shows good leadership.  \n\n \n\nFor our internal team, these are all comfortable changes with no sudden jolts that would concern me when speaking to: [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nGents 100% I am not being mischievous here. I want what is best, [REDACTED NAME] business, and I know my opinions are challenging for your both. I am sorry for that, but in equal measure I need to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME] and thoughts.\n\n \n\nI really hope this helps in some way.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

As I indicated, it’s a lot more complex than a simple “sales source”. The different data capture points have grown over many years to: [REDACTED NAME] different requirements. I have tried to: [REDACTED NAME] of these and provide a breakdown.\n\n \n\nThe single closest thing we have to a single source of truth is Sales source. This is driven from: [REDACTED NAME] up in web / app > F2F2 > Account open > Sales input into a new tab in F2F2 manually. If the sales guys used this properly, we genuinely have a better picture. There are some fail safes in here to: [REDACTED NAME] stop sales manipulating the inbound sales and saying they converted it. I found generally they took an inbound call or rang an existing web/app account and then claimed a conversion,. Yes its sales….its farming not hunting. Appreciate we need both. I have been here many times with sales. When we scratch the surface, we discover some bending of the truths.\n\n \n\nI always encouraged sales to: [REDACTED NAME] sales on an annual basis to deliver +20% costs. The year prior sales then became a  “house account”. Hence the reason converted by “X” 2024 / 2025 etc so we could track individual performance in that year.  \n\n \n\nNot complaining, we have done this exercise last year when we tried to: [REDACTED NAME] to follow a process. The original doc [REDACTED NAME] produced is also attached.\n\n \n\nAgain, not complaining, this took me 1h 45m today to: [REDACTED NAME] get into the details and test the data. I hope this helps you get a better understanding. Ordinarily I know you would go to: [REDACTED NAME] this, but I said I would deliver.\n\n \n\nMy POV, I think we make do with what we have and use it as intended and tighten up the process, or we bend the existing structures for new uses as you and John see fit. NB doing the second will muddy historical reporting. It’s not impossible, but please be-aware of the limitations this path would deliver. The data capture is complex and ties into many threads. As you know later this year, we will be looking to integrate a CRM, I would suggest that’s the time to: [REDACTED NAME] change things.\n\n \n\nHowever this might be a bit disappointing in terms of change, I hope that’s all helpful.\n\n \n\nHappy to: [REDACTED NAME] when we both have time.\n\n \n\nBest, [REDACTED NAME] [REDACTED NAME]\n\n \n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\nDirector\n\n[REDACTED NAME]\n\n[REDACTED EMAIL]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n+44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]\n\n\n\n[REDACTED ADDRESS]\n\nfreightlink.co.uk\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of this email is confidential and intended for the recipient specified in message only.

I will raise this with [REDACTED NAME].\n\n \n\nLike the OLA angle – makes sense. Perfect !\n\nThe basic structure is sound. Well done – you are very good at these.\n\n \n\nEach OLA needs to: [REDACTED NAME] specific.\n\n \n\nEg Item 1 – “Sales will do this, including this level of information, via this method of communication to Operations, and the desired output is that. Time frame to: [REDACTED NAME] X”\n\n \n\nImagine you are writing a set of instructions for a new starter – it must be that level of detail.\n\n \n\nI am not sure who has given you a steer on the “items” to: [REDACTED NAME] within the OLA. I think this need clearing up. I am guessing this will be [REDACTED NAME] and [REDACTED NAME] to finalise.\n\n \n\nUnlike a policy, I would make sure that the HOT are the signatories on this rather than directors. Make them responsible. If you want directors sign off, I recommend that the director responsible for the teams this impact signs off. EG In this instance, [REDACTED NAME] and I.

This unfortunately means we’re not in a position to: [REDACTED NAME] packages or costs at this time. The business is reliant on achieving its budget targets.\nWe shared our 2026 budget plans with you, which I trust you agree are realistic and take into account the challenges your team has faced this year. The budget reflects the current run rate with a 10% uplift, and you’ll also benefit from: [REDACTED NAME] work from: [REDACTED NAME] following John’s departure.\nYour continued commitment and support in delivering this plan is essential. You've made it clear that you do not wish to: [REDACTED NAME] hiring a new BDM at this stage, and we respect that decision. You know your clients and market better than anyone, and we support your approach. However, it’s vital that we see a clear recovery plan that drives growth.\nI was encouraged to: [REDACTED NAME] you and your team will take ownership of generating new sales. As you know, we’ve struggled to: [REDACTED NAME] this front in recent years, and we must avoid repeating that pattern in 2026.\nTo: [REDACTED NAME], we need to: [REDACTED NAME] a set of key KPIs that you and the team are fully aligned with. If we fall short of these KPIs, we must be prepared to: [REDACTED NAME] strategy. We cannot afford to: [REDACTED NAME] a plan that isn’t delivering results.

      "body": "Hi [REDACTED NAME],\n\n\nHaving had a few hours to: [REDACTED NAME] changes with Alex departing, this news presents immediate risks, but opportunities to deliver a considerable step up in our growth deliverables.\n\n\nI have therefore quickly produced a proposal for structural changes which provides the best, [REDACTED NAME] success. Let's schedule in a call to discuss. Happy to have a conversation today and discuss in detail next Tue when back in work.\n\n\nI hope this meets with your approval.\n\n\n-----\n\n\nProposed Strategy 2025-2027\nKey Focus: Profitability and Stability\n\n\nContext:\nWith the departure of [REDACTED NAME] (AM) at the end of April, Freightlink (FL) and CustomsLink (CL) must pivot strategy to: [REDACTED NAME] immediate impact and position the for long-term growth and stability. While the previous plan involved supporting AM in delivering major projects, [REDACTED NAME] (MS), will lead the transition, committing to: [REDACTED NAME] for the next five years to establish a robust structure that drives growth opportunities and ownership.\n\n\n---\n\n\nBusiness Overview:\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]  \n- Relationship-driven and technology-focused business.  \n- Relationships with ferry suppliers are critical to operations, supported by SaaS tools.  \n- Freight ferry industry has limited key decision-makers meaning reputation is critical\n- c.15 reputable freight ferry agencies across Europe.\n- Freightlink ranks third in size v competition with an UK / EU market freight ferry market share of <0.5%.\n\n\nCustomsLink  \n- Knowledge intensive business specializing in customs procedures presented via a SaaS platform.  \n- Software domain knowledge is mission-critical for operations.  \n- GB declaration market penetration of <0.01%.\n\n\nKey Success Factors:\n- Strong relationships with ferry operators.  \n- Domain expertise in customs knowledge and software.\n\n\n---\n\n\nChallenges:\n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]  \n- AM’s departure will destabilize operations for 3-6 months.  \n- Staff, especially [REDACTED NAME] (low flight risk), will require reassurance and support during this period.  \n\n\n[REDACTED NAME]  \n- Ferry operators will react with scepticism and speculate about potential company sale or increased Stena Line control. Competitors are likely to: [REDACTED NAME] to: [REDACTED NAME]’s market reputation.  \n- MS [REDACTED NAME] maintain direct, proactive engagement with ferry operators during the first 12 months to: [REDACTED NAME] concerns and reinforce trust.\n\n\n---\n\n\nStrategic Plan:\n\n\n2025 (April - December):\n- MS [REDACTED NAME] MD position; [REDACTED NAME] (JM) continues as Assistant MD.  \n- MS [REDACTED NAME] JM split responsibilities, leveraging their strengths to: [REDACTED NAME].  \n- Initiate senior recruitment for CustomsLink.  \n- MS [REDACTED NAME] on key staff development, particularly [REDACTED NAME], [REDACTED NAME], John, [REDACTED NAME], [REDACTED NAME], [REDACTED NAME], and the new Head of IT.  \n- Controlled response in the market with MS [REDACTED NAME] relationships with ferry operators.\n\n\n2026:\n- Recruit an Operations Director in Q2-Q3, with [REDACTED NAME] as a potential candidate.  \n- MS [REDACTED NAME] JM accelerate the development of the Operations Director, ensuring alignment with strategic goals.\n\n\n2027:\n- Transition Operations Director to: [REDACTED NAME].  \n- MS [REDACTED NAME] deliver project work 28+\n\n\n---\n\n\nAdvantages:\n1. Team Cohesion:\nMS [REDACTED NAME] full support to: [REDACTED NAME] business and drive growth plans. Distractions are minimized to: [REDACTED NAME] and MS [REDACTED NAME] focus on strategic execution.  \n2. Controlled Succession Plan: Smooth transition without knee-jerk recruitments. Succession planning aligns with growth milestones.  \n3. Market Confidence:\nProactive engagement with ferry operators prevents reputational risks and reinforces relationships.  \n4. Long-Term Commitment:\nMS [REDACTED NAME] through to 2030 ensures sustained progress and stability.\n\n\n---\n\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Delayed recruitment of a permanent MD.\n\n\n---\n\n\nKey 2025 Milestones:\n- Office relocation.  \n- Netherlands broker partnership established.  \n- Mediterranean sales micro-office operational.  \n- New Head of IT onboarded.  \n- Phase 1 of F3 (back end operational system) automation/AI implemented. \n- CustomsLink budget targets achieved.  \n- Senior Management Team (SMT) development plan activated.  \n- Realignment of MBO targets for JM and MS.\n\n\n---\n\n\nThis refined proposal maintains a clear focus on stability, profitability, and structured succession planning while addressing key challenges and opportunities. \n\n\nSuggested statement: External release as discussed; my suggestion would be to: [REDACTED NAME] comment regarding the MD position. Internal MS [REDACTED NAME] take on the MD role. Only ferry operators will be interested. MS [REDACTED NAME] be in contact: [REDACTED NAME] week.\n\n\nBR\n[REDACTED NAME]\nDirector\nM +44 (0) [REDACTED PHONE]",
